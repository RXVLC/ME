                    I consider myself a junior-level programmer, but I'm eager to learn and push myself to new heights every day.
                    Currently, I'm studying Web App Development and actively working to improve my skills as a developer.
                    I love tackling challenges with creative solutions, and I'm committed to making a meaningful contribution to the world of technology.
                    Thanks for visiting my website!

                    I have gained a solid knowledge of microcomputer systems, standing out for my skills in areas such as programming, network design, and technical
                    problem-solving. This achievement has demonstrated my ability to learn and apply skills effectively, which drives me to continue improving and growing
                    professionally in the field of information technology.

                    I am proud to have created different scripts, including a calculator, rock-paper-scissors game, and a gambling game.
                    But without a doubt, my best project so far has been the imitation of my high school's website, which allowed me to develop skills
                    in web design and programming. Each project I have undertaken has been a challenge, but thanks to them, I have learned to solve problems
                    and create practical solutions. I am excited to continue working on new projects and exploring everything that programming has to offer.
